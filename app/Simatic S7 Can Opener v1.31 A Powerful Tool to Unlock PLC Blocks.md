## Step 2: Open Your S7 Project or Library
 
Before running Simatic S7 Can Opener V1.31, make sure you close all applications that may interfere with your S7 project files, such as S7 Manager, S7 Editor, Protool, etc. Also, make a backup copy of your S7 project or library before using the tool, just in case something goes wrong.
 
Run CanOpener.exe and from Open menu select the desired S7 project or library. You will see a list of all blocks folders in your S7 project or library. If you have more than one S7 program in your project, you will see a list of all blocks folders for each program. You can filter different block families (FBs, FCs, OBs, DBs) by clicking on the tabs at the bottom.
