Zerene Stacker is a software that allows you to combine multiple images taken at different focus distances into one sharp image. It is especially useful for macro photography, where the depth of field is very shallow and you want to capture every detail of your subject. Zerene Stacker can also be used for landscape photography, where you want to have everything in focus from foreground to background.
 
If you want to use Zerene Stacker, you need to purchase a license key from the official website. The license key will be delivered as part of an email, and you need to install it into a running copy of Zerene Stacker. Here are the steps to do that:
 
**Download Zip ⇒⇒⇒ [https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fblltly.com%2F2uyt8L&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0pgodaxyUBDLsP2ombNC6d](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fblltly.com%2F2uyt8L&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0pgodaxyUBDLsP2ombNC6d)**


 
1. Open the email that contains the license key. Find the portion that starts with `==== BEGIN LICENSE KEY ====` and ends with `==== END LICENSE KEY ====`. Select (highlight) the entire license key, including the lines with four equal signs. Copy the license key to clipboard using control-C or command-C.
2. Launch Zerene Stacker, then go to Options > Registrationâ¦ in the menus. Paste the license key into the Registration window using the âPaste from clipboardâ button at the bottom of the window. This should make the âEnterâ button change from disabled (gray letters) to enabled (black letters). If the âEnterâ button does not become enabled, then some problem has occurred in transferring the license. Be sure that you have included all the equal signs, and that any accented or non-English characters appear correctly. If you still cannot make the âEnterâ button become enabled, then contact support@zerenesystems.com.
3. When the âEnterâ button becomes enabled, press it. This will record the license key and make the Registration window disappear. The title bar of Zerene Stacker should now show the name that the license was issued to.
4. You can confirm that the license has been accepted by going to Help > About Zerene Stacker. If your license does not expire (and most do not), then the box will not show a âLicense expires at:â line.

Now you are ready to use Zerene Stacker to create stunning images with high depth of field. You can find tutorials and examples on how to use Zerene Stacker on the official website or on YouTube. Enjoy!

### Zerene Stacker Features
 
Zerene Stacker has several features that make it stand out from other focus stacking software. Here are some of them:

- Highest quality output images, especially in difficult cases. Zerene Stacker can handle challenging subjects such as overlapping structures, low contrast areas, and blurred edges without losing detail or creating artifacts.
- Accurate and robust alignment and interpolation. Zerene Stacker can align images taken with different lenses, cameras, or orientations, and can correct for perspective distortion and vignetting. It can also interpolate missing pixels caused by gaps or occlusions in the stack.
- Advanced stacking algorithms. Zerene Stacker offers two major stacking methods: PMax and DMap. PMax is a pyramid method that preserves fine details even in low contrast or slightly blurred areas. DMap is a depth map method that keeps the original smoothness and colors of the images. You can use either method or combine them using retouching.
- Clean handling of hairs and bristles. Zerene Stacker can avoid halos and contour lines around thin structures such as hairs and bristles, which are common problems with other stacking software.
- Fast and flexible retouching. Zerene Stacker allows you to easily edit the stacked image by copying pixels from any source image or any other output image. You can use retouching to fix errors, enhance details, or blend different algorithms.
- Supports 8- and 16-bit input and output files. Zerene Stacker can work with JPEG, TIFF, PNG, BMP, PSD, RAW, DNG, CR2, NEF, ORF, PEF, ARW, SRW files and more.
- Can generate stereo and 3-D rocking animations from a single stack. Zerene Stacker can create realistic stereo pairs
