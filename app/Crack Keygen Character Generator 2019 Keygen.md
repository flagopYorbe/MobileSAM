In this article, we will review some of the features and benefits of CC3 and show you how to get started with creating your own 3D characters.
 
## What is Character Creator 3?
 
Character Creator 3 is a software that lets you design and customize 3D characters from scratch or from a library of ready-made templates. You can choose from different body shapes, skin tones, facial features, hairstyles, clothing, accessories, and more. You can also adjust the proportions, poses, expressions, and animations of your characters.
 
CC3 supports both realistic and stylized characters, with different levels of detail and quality. You can create photorealistic human characters with lifelike skin, hair, eyes, teeth, and muscles. You can also create cartoon-like or anime-style characters with exaggerated features and expressions.
 
CC3 is compatible with iClone, Maya, Blender, Unreal Engine, Unity, and other 3D tools. You can export your characters as FBX or OBJ files and use them in your preferred 3D software. You can also import your own custom models or assets into CC3 and edit them with the built-in tools.
 
## What are the benefits of Character Creator 3?
 
Character Creator 3 offers many advantages for 3D character creation. Here are some of them:
 
- It saves you time and money. You don't need to spend hours modeling, sculpting, texturing, rigging, or animating your characters from scratch. You can use the existing templates or modify them to suit your needs. You can also save your custom characters as presets and reuse them later.
- It gives you creative freedom and flexibility. You can create any type of character you want, from realistic to stylized, from human to non-human. You can mix and match different elements and styles to create unique and diverse characters. You can also fine-tune every aspect of your character's appearance and behavior.
- It enhances your workflow and productivity. You can easily integrate CC3 with other 3D tools and platforms. You can export your characters as standard formats that are compatible with most 3D software. You can also import your own models or assets into CC3 and edit them with the same tools.
- It improves your quality and performance. CC3 uses advanced technologies such as PBR (physically based rendering), HDRP (high definition render pipeline), SSS (subsurface scattering), and DAZ (digital art zone) to create realistic and high-quality characters. CC3 also optimizes your characters for different platforms and devices, such as PC, mobile, VR, AR, etc.
