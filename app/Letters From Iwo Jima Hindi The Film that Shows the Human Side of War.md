Some interesting facts about the Battle of Iwo Jima are:
 
- The battle was made famous by Joe Rosenthal's photograph of the raising of the U.S. flag on top of the 166 m (545 ft) Mount Suribachi[^1^]. The photograph became a symbol of American victory and patriotism, and inspired the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia.
- The battle lasted 36 days, from February 19 to March 26, 1945. It was one of the longest and bloodiest battles in the Pacific theater of World War II.
- An extensive tunnel system was dug by the Japanese which was around 11 miles (17.7 kms) long and land mines were also placed all over the island[^2^]. The tunnels allowed the Japanese to move around and resupply without being exposed to American fire. The land mines posed a constant threat to the advancing Marines.
- The island is small, with an area of just eight square miles (20 square km) and a length of about five miles (eight km)[^3^]. It is also volcanic and covered with gray ash and sand that made movement difficult. The island's name means "sulfur island" in Japanese, reflecting its sulfurous gases and smell.
- The U.S. forces outnumbered the Japanese by more than 3:1, with 70,000 Marines against 22,060 Japanese defenders[^4^]. However, the Japanese fought with fierce determination and refused to surrender. It is estimated that only 216 Japanese soldiers were taken prisoner, while the rest were killed or committed suicide.
